* Colemak
* I had RSI very badly in 2012. Colemak *greatly* reduces the distance your fingers travel. An unbelievable number of words
* can be typed on the home row. It keeps your ctrl-c/ctrl-v/ctrl-x and punctuation keys in the same location this
* is why I chose it over Dvorak.
* If you're desperate enough to learn Colemak and already own a Kinesis Advantage, make sure you try out a vertical mouse too!
* The vertical mouse helped me the most, followed by the Kinesis Advantage, followed by Colemak.
