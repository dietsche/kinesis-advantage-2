# Personal Layouts
Make a backup of your layout, and help other people learn tips and tricks from your customizations at the same time!

We're accepting your personal kinesis advantage layouts in this folder. Please create the files using your github user name and the base layout (qwerty/dvorak). For example, I'm "farmergreg" and my layout is based on qwerty so my file is named "farmergreg_qwerty.txt"

Please take time to make comments in your file, and remove any macros that shouldn't be shared with the public.
